This project focuses on classifying occupied properties ("okupadas") using machine learning techniques. It involves incremental data scraping, cleaning, and feature engineering to enhance model performance. Geospatial features and area-specific occupation metrics were created to improve classification accuracy. With iterative improvements raising the F1-score from 37% to 59%.
